In your group, {{ group.num_cooperators }} cooperated and {{ group.num_stealers }} tried to steal.

This is a mock round, so your energy level is still {{ player.participant.payoff }}. If the round was real, it would now be {{player.mock_payoff}}. 
Your payoff is {{ player.Payoff }}. Remember that if it falls below 100, the payoff is slashed by 10. {% if player.participant.payoff < Constants.threshold %} 
<strong>(-10)</strong>
{% endif %}

{% if player.participant.payoff < Constants.threshold %} 
<strong>You are currently below the threshold!</strong>
